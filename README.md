# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Approach-and-Methodology

In this project, the task is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a new patient
is likely to have diabetes. The dataset includes essential features like age, insulin levels, blood
pressure, and blood sugar levels. The main goal is to create an accurate binary classification model
that categorizes patients into two groups: those likely to have diabetes and those unlikely to have
diabetes.

The approach starts with data exploration and preprocessing, involving the examination of data,
handling missing values, and analyzing feature distributions. Several popular classification
algorithms, such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
Random Forest, will be trained and compared for their performance on the test data. The aim is to
identify the most effective classifier for this specific problem.

To further enhance the selected model's performance, fine-tuning techniques will be explored,
including hyperparameter adjustments and addressing potential class imbalance. This process aims
to optimize the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities, ensuring it performs well on
unseen data.
